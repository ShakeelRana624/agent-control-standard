# Governance

ACS is an OWASP project. This file records who leads the work, which workstream owns which surface, and how leadership changes.

## Project lead

| Role | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Project Lead | Rock Lambros ([@rocklambros](https://github.com/rocklambros)) |

## Workstream leads

Each workstream owns a slice of the standard and runs its own review. Two leads per
workstream keeps decisions moving when one is unavailable.

Reference Implementation runs with one lead so far, and Documentation and Testing and
Validation have none. The work in each continues, but it carries a single point of
failure, or no owner at all, until somebody takes the open seats.

| Workstream | Leads |

| Coding Agents | Almog Langleben ([@almogbhl](https://github.com/almogbhl)), Stefano Amorelli ([@stefanoamorelli](https://github.com/stefanoamorelli)) |
| Development (SDK) | Rock Lambros ([@rocklambros](https://github.com/rocklambros)), Fred Wilmot ([@fewdisc](https://github.com/fewdisc)) |
| Documentation | Open |
| Identity | Eva Benn ([@evabenn](https://github.com/evabenn)), Richard Bird ([@RbBuiltWrong](https://github.com/RbBuiltWrong)) |
| Outreach | Eva Benn ([@evabenn](https://github.com/evabenn)), Aruneesh Salhotra ([@aruneeshsalhotra](https://github.com/aruneeshsalhotra)) |

| Spec | Bar Kaduri ([@bar-capsule](https://github.com/bar-capsule)), Ariel Fogel ([@afogel](https://github.com/afogel)) |
| Testing and Validation | Open |

## Triage authority

Workstream leads and the project lead apply the decision labels: `scope:`, `priority:`,
`workstream:`, and `status:accepted`. No issue form can apply one.

A workstream lead or the project lead may assign a volunteer or contributor to triage
alongside them. An assigned volunteer applies any label, decision labels included, and the
lead who assigned them reviews those calls and owns them. The project lead grants them the
repository's `triage` role and write access to the
[project board](https://github.com/orgs/GenAI-Security-Project/projects/9).

Minimum triage on a new issue is two labels, `scope:` and `status:`. `priority:` and
`workstream:` are enrichment applied to accepted work. Requiring four decisions per issue
is how a taxonomy stops getting used in month two.

`priority:P0` is reserved for work on the serial chain the Strategic Adoption Plan names:
the mandatory floor decision, the adapters, the installable Guardian, and the
interoperability benchmark. It does not mean important.

Triage runs on the weekly call. Promotion from `integration` to `main` is a standing item
on the same call, and the project lead owns merging it.

## Origins

Michael Bargury ([@mbrg](https://github.com/mbrg)) and Ory Segal ([@oorryy](https://github.com/oorryy)) created ACS. Both remain project leaders.

## Why this roster and project.owasp.yaml differ

`project.owasp.yaml` feeds the OWASP Nest project index. Its schema caps `leaders` at five entries and gives each person a name, an email, a GitHub handle, and a Slack handle. No field carries a role, a workstream, or a founding credit.

That file therefore names three people: the project lead and the two creators. This file is the authoritative roster.

## How leadership changes

Existing leads propose additions and removals. The project lead confirms the change, then opens a pull request that updates this file and `.github/CODEOWNERS` together. When the change touches the project lead or a creator, the same pull request updates `project.owasp.yaml`, since those are the only people it names.

The CODEOWNERS update is not optional. A lead who loses write access stops being a valid owner, and GitHub fails the entry silently rather than flagging it.
