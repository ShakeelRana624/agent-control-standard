"""Apply the Phase 2 contribution-governance configuration to the live repository.

Phase 2 of design/plans/2026-09-09-contribution-governance.md is a 14-step manual
runbook of `gh` commands. Hand-typing it once, the night before a public relaunch, is
how a repository ends up half-migrated: a label renamed but the milestones missed, or
a ruleset created twice with slightly different settings the second time. This module
turns the steps that are safe to automate into one idempotent, dry-runnable tool, so
running it twice against the same live state is a no-op rather than a second mutation.

The desired state lives in plain functions (`desired_labels`, `desired_milestones`,
`desired_issues`, `desired_rulesets`) that take no arguments and touch no network. The
diff between that desired state and a live-state dict is `plan_actions`, also pure.
Only `fetch_live_state` and `run_action` touch the network, and only `main` calls them,
so the interesting logic runs under test without a `gh` binary or a token.

SAFETY PROPERTY: this tool cannot merge a pull request, close one, retarget one, or
delete a label. Those are either human decisions (Phase 2 Steps 3, 6, 7, and 8 promote
or merge someone else's work) or destructive (a deleted label vanishes from every issue
that carried it). No function in this module builds a `gh` argv that merges, closes,
or edits a pull request, or that deletes a label, and `HUMAN_STEPS` below says so out
loud when asked for one of the steps that requires a person.

The `board` step reconciles the org-level project board from the same label taxonomy,
since the board's built-in GitHub workflows add, close, and merge an item but cannot
move it when a maintainer applies a label, and the label is what the governance turns
on. It only adds a project item or changes its Status field, never archives or removes
one, and it runs under a maintainer's own `gh` credentials rather than a token stored
in the repository, because the board is organization-owned and a workflow's
`GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot write to it.
